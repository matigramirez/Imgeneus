That''s why no one here dares to go there, even though the story is as famous as any faerie''s tale. A little while back, there was this guy named Lotus who said he wanted to seek out the Singing Tree - I think he was a few swords short of an armory, if you know what I mean.He''s been gone for quite a while now, and nobody has heard from him since he left. Well...that''s what everybody expected. I even remember the day he left, because he kept going on about how he''d tell us all about the Singing Tree when he returned.Anyway, Mulus of Aelbeageu has been worried about him and told me to find him no matter what happens, but I''m not particularly inclined to do it. Would you mind seeking out this wayward fool in my stead?According to the legend, you can find the Singing Tree somewhere to the northeast of here.

Because this spell requires a dangerous cost, even that family couldn''t use it and had no choice but to simply store it in their safekeeping.However, one sily human of that family used that spell for his own ends and vanished into thin air because of the curse of Etain. After that, Etain put that scroll into a box, sealed it off, and hid it somewhere in Teos.Recently, one man described a box similar to the one in the tale. If it really is true, this is a BIG deal. This means the seal placed on the box has been weakened. We have to strengthen the seal again as fast as we can.If possible, you should look for the guy who witnessed that box and listen to his story.Find this box, if possible, and bring it to me.

The lakes and waterways have been providing nutrition not only to people, but also to the forest trees and creatures living in this district. But recently, I''ve been tracking some contaminants in the lakes, things we haven''t seen before. As a result, the quality of our water has degraded dramatically. Even more evidence of this is found in some of the creatures that live right on the water''s edge... they have become violent and act strangely. I intend to capture these warped creatures and collect some specimens. This way, I can figure out what has been contaminating the lake. Can you help me?

However, they''ve hardly ever harmed people unnecessarily. I know there were a couple of peculiar pixies among them, but attacking travelers passing by in groups was a very rare occurrence. However, recently, this kind of accident has been growing in frequency.It is my conjecture, but it is likely there is a certain pixie exercising her considerable influence over all the pixies living in the Eldain Woods and driving them to hatred against humans. I can''t fathom why a pixie like that would keep coming into being. I guess in the overall hierarchy, she might be like a queen to them.  I need information about that ''queen'' pixie.

I mean, she will be more difficult to cope with than other pixies, but she shouldn''t be that difficult to fight, either.

My mission is to find a hero who will get rid of heretics - Maitreyan Orcs who have been extending their power in the center of Willieoseu. I was told Orcs worship their king as God. This is ridiculous. It''s not someting that can be overlooked by people of the Deities Religion, who serve only the Goddess Etain! In addition, they are trying to build an empire for only Orcs by gathering together various Orc clans that are scattered around. Their center of operations seems to be the very Maitreyan Orc Base Camp north of here. Also, I''ve heard a rumor they''re buying over other clans living in the forest, in addition to their Orcish allies. I don''t know exactly if Shaiyawoods are actually threatened or controlled by them, but I was told they are brutally killing people who are trying to enter the Maitreyan camp!Maybe the fact I met a hero like you so fast clearly shows the goddess is helping us.

With abilities that were unimaginably magnificent, perhaps even above mortals, he banished the Dianoia family to Cornwell''s Ruin and cut off the head of the God of another world, sealing him off in the rift from whence he came.

However, a while ago, suspicious forces were discovered nearby.Through the result of research, it turned out they were Chaos Elves who betrayed the Elves during the war against Sunting Manaburn...It is also possible they are trying to resurrect the God of Another World again.Before their force grows, we have to stop them.

I wander the area trying to inform everyone who passes through here about the dangers this place once held. You see, Cornwell''s Ruin is an ancient prison that was built after the war between the Dianoia family and the Elves more than a thousand years ago. This place stood long before humans ever appeared on this continent.The Dianoia family were monsters made by an unknown being called St. Evil Spirit. Their abilities seemd to rival even those of the Elves. After they first appeared in this world, the Elves began losing their powers as nature was being destroyed all around them. The Elves'' last stand was in Cornwell Forest, where they drove the Dianoia into a cave located at the corner of the forest and sealed them in for all time.The cave remained sealed for over a thousand years, but in the end, the power of time was greater than the seal placed on the cave. The evil that was locked inside began seeping into the surrounding countryside and raising the long-dead warriors within the ruins.{c5}(The old man begins to ramble on about names and places you think you may have heard about as a child. Hours seem to go by. You begin to understand why the guard dislikes this old man.){/c}Am I boring you?!

Many of the family of Dianoia were sacrificed for the blood ritual, and even more were killed by the beast himself.A while back, my master entered Cornwell''s Ruin in search of this beast. He had heard that it still wandered the dungeons deep in the ruins. A week after he entered the ruins, some travelers found him dead on the path near here...

I want you to avenge my master in the name of this feeble Elf. Now, according to his diary, the Devil has a skull-like head and hides deep within the Temple of Cornwell''s Ruin. It wields an enormous sword that can cleave through any metal, and is cloaked with a long cape enchanted with magical powers. While roaming the halls, he has the ability to walk unseen. He has great spiritual energy allowing him to smash even the most powerful foes, and he is followed by minions who obey his every command. Now, I know I may look frail to you, traveler, but in the many years I''ve spent here, I have accumulated many Lapis gems - some very powerful. These are priceless treasures, and I will gladly give them to you if you do this for me. ','If you see this Devil, tell me what he looks like.

That ancient writing included stories about some sort of creatures trapped under a curse within the walls of the ruin. I couldn''t decipher all of the text, but it seems that the Vail used to channel spirits in that temple when it was still standing. They would use these spirits to manifest great power and even use them as weapons against their enemies.No Vail dares go to that place to channel spirits any longer, and that''s mainly because of two enormous monsters who dwell within. I don''t know how they came into existence, but those monsters are securing the ruin''s underground first floor and second floor. They keep the evil spirits from passing on and finding rest, and they also prevent us from studying the spirits.Could you please gather a party and destroy those abominations?

In my case, I succeeded my father''s research about the evil spirit, so we''ve basically been researching this issue for two generations.Long ago, in the age when we were able to control evil spirits very smoothly, I was told people used to contact creatures from another world, using those evil spirits. After the clan of humans appeared in Teos, the war has continued on, so from that moment, people have been researching about things that have more direct application in war, like this alchemy, rather than the evil spirits. That''s why you see fewer scholars like me these days.However, a little while ago, we realized that we can do somthing with that evil spirit. The problem is, our research is difficult to carry out because we can''t obtain those evil spirits anywhere.

The Orcs becoming an active military power would be a very serious problem in the midst of the war against the Union of Fury. The King, William Typhon, ordered us to stop the Orcs from becoming any more powerful.However, in this situation, we can''t pull knights from the forefront of the war to take care of threats at our back.

If you can help us in this moment of difficulty, we''ll recognize you as an honorary member of the Stardust Knights in the name of His Majesty the King. A royal gift awaits you at the successful completion of this mission too.But anyway, let me get back to business. There is a powerful group of orcs called the WarEdge Clan that roams in both the west and east of the Adellia district.The messenger sent from Maitreyan hasn''t reached them yet; at this point, we''re lucky they''ve yet to form an alliance with the Orcs in Maitreyan. Before they respond to Maitreyan''s offer of alliance, we have to cause them damage so massive that they are incapable of cementing an alliance. First, I''d like you to destroy the WarEdge clan near the Arvea Feller''s Town in the east of the district.

Normally, we''d let them sort it out themselves, but sometimes, the Elves'' problems don''t just impact the Elves - with the Alliance formed between Elves and Humans, their problems can become our problems as well. Currently, Ankylul WildDark, the King of the Orcs and a very powerful warrior-magician, is being revived in Maitreyan. The Elves sustained considerable damage in their last war against the Orcs.The Elves suspect that Ankylul hasn''t regained all his power yet. In order to get rid of him, there are other problems we need to address first. First, I''d like you to meet with Mulus Toreo in Aelbeageu and deliver this letter to him.

Ankylul is a descendant of Oak, one of the Telaiosis who existed before even we Elves came into being long ago. The result of our ancestors'' sin are the cursed and depraved beings we know today as Orcs. This is why their ruler, Ankylul, has a small portion of the power of the Telaiosis, and why they bear us such enmity. We sustained great losses in the past trying to take down Ankylul. At this time, Ankylul hasn''t recovered his full power, nor has he roused the Orc clans scattered throughout this land and bound them into a great army.

On behalf of His Majesty, the King of glorious Apulune, let me be the first to acknowledge the bravery you''ve shown thus far.However, currently, the spear-rattling of the Orcs is becoming harder and harder to ignore. The Orcs becoming an active military power would be a very serious problem in the midst of the war against the Union of Fury. The King, William Typhon, ordered us to stop the Orcs from becoming any more powerful.However, I can safely say there are no knights here to fight against the Orcs, except the knights assigned to guard Apulune - at the moment, every knight we can spare has been sent to the forefront of combat.If you can help us in this moment of difficulty, we''ll recommend you for recognition as an honorary member of the Royal Knights in the name of His Majesty the King. A royal gift awaits you at the successful completion of this mission too.But anyway, let me get back to business. There is a powerful group of orcs called the WarEdge Clan that roams in both the west and east of the Adellia district.The messenger sent from Maitreyan hasn''t reached them yet; at this point, we''re lucky they''ve yet to form an alliance with the Orcs in Maitreyan. Before they respond to Maitreyan''s offer of alliance, we have to cause them damage so massive that they are incapable of cementing an alliance.

Normally, we''d let them sort it out themselves, but sometimes, the Elves'' problems don''t just impact the Elves - with the Alliance formed between Elves and Humans, their problems can become our problems as well. Currently, Ankylul WildDark, the King of the Orcs and a very powerful warrior-magician, is being revived in Maitreyan. The Elves sustained considerable damage in their last war against the Orcs.The Elves suspect that Ankylul hasn''t regained all his power yet. In order to get rid of him, there are other problems we need to address first. First, I''d like you to meet with Mulus Toreo in Aelbeageu and deliver this letter to him.

Ankylul is a descendant of Oak, one of the Telaiosis who existed before even we Elves came into being long ago. The result of our ancestors'' sin are the cursed and depraved beings we know today as Orcs. This is why their ruler, Ankylul, has a small portion of the power of the Telaiosis, and why they bear us such enmity. We sustained great losses in the past trying to take down Ankylul. At this time, Ankylul hasn''t recovered his full power, nor has he roused the Orc clans scattered throughout this land and bound them into a great army.

If you prove Etain''s power, it will set an example for all brothers and sisters of our religion. You''ll be recognized as both a member of Deities Religion and a faithful servant of Etain. There will no doubt be a gift awaiting you when you accomplish your mission as well.But anyway, let me get back to business.

Ankylul is a descendant of Oak, one of the Telaiosis who existed before even we Elves came into being long ago. The result of our ancestors'' sin are the cursed and depraved beings we know today as Orcs. This is why their ruler, Ankylul, has a small portion of the power of the Telaiosis, and why they bear us such enmity. We sustained great losses in the past trying to take down Ankylul. At this time, Ankylul hasn''t recovered his full power, nor has he roused the Orc clans scattered throughout this land and bound them into a great army.

Apparently, they had been the denizens of that place for a long time. Originally, Acre was one of the high priests in charge of managing the Aidion Neckria. In fact, Acre was the very person who first discovered that the Aidion Neckria was occupied by devils from another dimension. However, Acre didn''t report the devils he discovered to the Senator. Avarice had blinded his good sensibilities - he must''ve thought he could take advantage of these devils'' power.However, these devils from another dimension were not beings that would be so easily controlled. One of them took advantage of Acre until he regained the power he lost when he entered this dimension. Once this devil regained his power, he betrayed Acre, and instantly Aidion Neckria was turned into the scene of a massacre.Acre became afraid that his transgression would be uncovered, and he escaped in the chaos, but as you can see, he paid the ultimate price in the end. However, we''re now in a position where we have to work together with the Vail to deal with these devils. Take this letter to Panakeia Lab in Reikeuseu.

Apparently, they had been the denizens of that place for a long time. Originally, Acre was one of the high priests in charge of managing the Aidion Neckria. In fact, Acre was the very person who first discovered that the Aidion Neckria was occupied by devils from another dimension. However, Acre didn''t report the devils he discovered to the Senator. Avarice had blinded his good sensibilities - he must''ve thought he could take advantage of these devils'' power.However, these devils from another dimension were not beings that would be so easily controlled. One of them took advantage of Acre until he regained the power he lost when he entered this dimension. Once this devil regained his power, he betrayed Acre, and instantly Aidion Neckria was turned into the scene of a massacre.Acre became afraid that his transgression would be uncovered, and he escaped in the chaos, but as you can see, he paid the ultimate price in the end. However, we''re now in a position where we have to work together with the Vail to deal with these devils. Take this letter to Panakeia Lab in Reikeuseu.

Are you interested in hearing a little more?Ever since Iskiel led us to settle down here, Faila has felt strangely anxious due to the constant energy emanating from the Mirr''os Hills. That''s an excessively dangerous place, and fierce have often been seen roaming around there, so people seldom venture down that way.The problem is, the most important area for mining the ore called the elementalium that we can only get in Skulleron is the Mirr''os Hills. Maybe those Union of Fury fiends were familiar with these monsters, but now that we Alliance of Light folks have settled down, these HellTeeth monsters seem a lot more organized than we first thought.Faila seems to feel disconcerted by these HellTeeth. She''s already devoted her full concentration to purifying the energy of the district - a kind we''re unfamiliar with. Not until we uncover the reality of the HellTeeth will she be able to relax.Can you head out to Mirr''os? I''d like you to cut down the number of Golems and HellTooth Parasites in that area.

I hope you keep in mind that this mission is a really crucial mission for the peace of both the Keuraijen district as well as the Starfumos district.

Once the durability of weapon reaches zero, you can''t attack easily, and once the durability of armor reaches zero, you''ll start taking more damage. That''s why you''ve gotta keep them in good repair to use them properly.If you want to fix your gear, all you have to do is find a blacksmith like me in any village.

If you feel it''s bothersome to fix them one by one and want to fix all your equipment together at once, just click "Repair All." The cost is indicated before the the repairs, so you''ll always know what you''re gettin'' into before you spend a single cent - always helpful, right?Then, can you see "Lapis Fusion"? You might wonder what a Lapis is. According to the legends, Lapises are mysterious stones also known as the "Goddess''s Tears." Each Lapis has a different ability, so they''re used to reinforce all sorts of equipment. But it doesn''t mean you can combine every piece of equipment with a lapis. Lapis fusion is possible from Noble-class equipment onward, so you''re better off not wasting your time with attaching lapises to low-level equipment.Well, anyway, fusing lapises is a blacksmith''s job. Similar to weapon repairs, if you speak to a blacksmith and choose "repair weapon," you will see a "forge" window, right? This time, you''d select the "lapis fusion" option. Then you''ll see a window where you can fuse a lapis with a piece of equipment, or extract a fused lapis from a piece of equipment."Fusion object" is where you put the equipment you can fuse a lapis with, and "Fusion item" is where you put a lapis you''ll fuse to equipment. However, you can only put equipment here if it''s not currently equipped on you. And remember that a fusion attempt doesn''t always result in success. Each fusion has a certain probability of occurring, so the process can end in either success or failure. If you fail the fusion attempt, the lapis will be broken. It''s a calculated risk, but the lapis will make you much stronger, so I think you''ll find it useful! Now, you should stop by {c2}Mano{/c]''s place before you go back to Batan - Mano''s really capable armor artisan. I''ll bet {c2}Batan Animus{/c} has something else to ask you again, too.

Don''t think of it as expensive; warehouse keepers need to make a living too.At first, the amount of warehouse space you can use will be limited, but if you purchase additional space from the item mall, you can greatly expand your warehouse space - keep that in mind. Also, since warehouse space is shared between all your characters on one account, all your characters can access the things you''ve stored within it!However, you can''t store money here - this is no bank, after all. Warehouses are meant for storing items, weapons, and armor only.I''m glad to see you''ve paid close attention - I pray your mind be as quick in all things! Anyway, Lia is certainly devoted. I can''t believe she''s cooking every month for someone she''s not even sure will come back. Well...I just realized you probably have no idea what I''m talking about since you''re new around here, right? I''d like to tell you, but...as you can see, I''m terribly busy. Please give this food materials box to Kaff, the cook. He''s very talkative, but he''s a pretty damn good cook all the same. You can trust him. Well then, I''m counting on you!','','What are you still doing here? Lazy folk never rise to the top!','0','0','0','0'),

You brought me some High Grade Food Materials again? Every time I get another shipment of these, I feel like they''re puttin'' demands on my skills as a cook... But anyway, enough of that! I''ve gotta show my great skill again! Anyway, so why are you still here? Haha...you must be that errand runner {c2}Lia Kreis{/c} sent. How did you feel when you saw {c2}Lia Kreis{/c} for the first time? She''s so beautiful, isn''t she? I''d buy a poster if she was on it~Actually, there was a friend {c2}Lia Kreis{/c} had been hanging out with since she was young. But eventually, their friendship ratcheted up a notch and things started to get a bit steamy. The guy is a bit of a pipe-dreamer, though; he has all these ideas of being the greatest mage in the Union of Fury. His name is {c2}Nazek{/c}, the first-class magician . {c2}Lia{/c} makes tasty food with the best-grade ingredients once a month, and sends it to him. But his world is full of studying and he ends up skipping a lot of meals. That''s why {c2}Lia Kreis{/c} is all alone, making her food with such dedication...I do hope they''ll eventually get married, and I know I''m not the only one who hopes so. But seriously? {c2}Nazek{/c} is a first-class idiot! I think he still thinks {c2}Lia Kreis{/c} is just a good friend. Blows my mind, it does!I assume it will take some time to complete the food. Those high-grade ingredients do take a lot of care to prepare, after all. Oh...by the by, do you know how to open a private shop? Of course, you have no idea, do you? Excellent!I shall impart this useful knowledge to you! If you look at the bottom of right side of the screen, you''ll see the icon where you can open the inventory, status window, or etc. If you press an auxillary skill icon there, you can use a gesture or other commands you can utilize via hotkey or a single click. If you press the ''Private Shop'' Icon near the bottom there, a window where you can put an item appears. If you put an item here, the item is registered to your private shop. After that, you input a price and a title of sign, you can open a private shop. It''s so easy, isn''t it? Oh...most importantly, you can only open private shops in the capital, so you''ll want to keep that in mind when you''re thinking of selling any of your wares.Oops...did I talk your ear off again? Sorry, sorry; I get like that when I''m all caught up in cooking, you know!Well, that''s about all you need to know for now. But say, errand runner...I already packed this - you know what it is, right? Can you hand {c2}Lia Kreis{/c}''s passionate dishes to that dumbass who just studies all the time instead of paying attention to her? I think you can do it, and if you come through, I''ll treat you to something truly excellent!','','Nazek...I really envy him~ I''d better ask Marie Jernes to look after me like that, haha!','0','0','0','0'),

You didn''t come here to learn magic, but you brought some food? Ah...{c2}Lia Kreis{/c} definitely sent this. You''ve heard about me from the folks in the village, have you? I''m glad that they''re concerned about my welfare, but this is more like...some sort of soap opera.Anyway, as you know, {c2}Lia Kreis{/c} always prepares some food to send to me once a month. The folks in the village somehow got it in their heads that I don''t think of {c2}Lia Kreis{/c} as anything more than a friend, but...to tell the truth, I''ve had the hots for Lia for YEARS. The reason for my actions being what they are is because I''m not sure when my studies in magic will be complete, and I don''t want {c2}Lia{/c} to worry about me. I suppose that''s how I must seem to everyone else. What others think doesn''t bother me all that much, but...I feel bad about {c2}Lia{/c}, thinking about how I''ve acted with her.Anyway, I''m supposed to give you some good information because you''ve come all the way to make a delivery for that chatterbox. Maybe that''s how you came to meet {c2}Lia Kreis{/c} in the first place.What I''m going to tell you is a story about the capital. I often venture to the capital frequently to study higher-level magic. Our capital, {c4}Iris{/c}, pretty much functions as the nerve center of the Union of Fury. Narsilian Hall is where the Senators conduct their daily work, including legislation and administration of justice, and all cases pertaining to the Vail are heard here. Also, the capital has the most active community, as well as special items and facilities you probably haven''t seen in other villages or cities.For example, there''s a cape merchant, and a merchant selling a vehicle you can''t find in other cities. Also, there''s a smuggler around, so you can trade items and other things with those from the Alliance of Light. For reference, you''d better remember you can''t fight with other forces there. And of course, you can''t forget the underground stadium where you can fight enemies from the Alliance of Light in fair, judged matches. If you want to go to the smugglers'' place and the underground stadium, just talk to the gate keeper. He''ll let you go there once you can pony up the cost.{c5}(He seems deeply distressed about something){/c} Okay! I''ve made up my mind! When my studies are over, I''m definitely gonna propose to {c2}Lia Kreis{/c}!Hey, I know you''ve been having a hard time, always running errands, but...do you think you could do a little somethin'' for me? This is a toy that {c2}Lia{/c} scrimped and saved to buy for me when she and I were young. I doubt she''s ever thought that I''d still be treasuring it today, haha. Can you give this to her? Give it to her and tell her that when I return someday...I''ll make her the happiest woman in the land!I''m looking forward to hearing about her reaction~','','I''ll be the best magician in the Union of Fury, and make her happy without fail!','0','0','0','0'),

It was then, one of the Union of Fury assassins found me and notched back an arrow. Then... I took a girl who turned the corner, using her as a shield to protect my sorry skin... After that, I saw a quick blur rush the Furies and I was knocked out. When I came to, I awoke beside the enemy, necks broken. I saw an old man crying with that same girl who I killed resting gently in his arms. I regretted being alive. I could not die and I ran before he saw me. I was a coward... I left the army. Everything felt so empty. In a week, I destroyed what I had built all my life. I suffered nightmares every night. I thought the way for redemption is to look for a place to die.
